NAME
    jobtop - show the output of top on hosts used by batch jobs

SYNOPSIS
    jobtop [BJOBS_OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
    For each host involved in the jobs matched by bjobs called with the given 
    options, print relevant output from top.  Only processes owned by the 
    owner(s) of the jobs are shown.  Common (usually non-interesting) parent 
    LSF and MPI processes (res, orted, etc.) are omitted.  Each output from top 
    is trimmed to 20 lines.  This also prints the total number of cores 
    allocated to the given jobs on that host, and their job IDs.

    This runs top over ssh.  Since nodes are usually busy running the jobs, 
    individual ssh commands can take a while.  Thus, this runs them in parallel 
    (within a sliding window).  That also means there can be a long delay 
    before seeing any output, while all the output is compiled.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Show this help.
    
    All other options/arguments are passed as-is to bjobs (actually, bjobs2, 
    which accepts the most common bjobs arguments; see \`bjobs2 --help' for 
    details).

REQUIREMENTS
    bjobs2

BUGS
    This lists all processes owned by the user, but it should be able to use 
    bjobs2's pgid and have ps only look for those.
